lesson 3 reflections, created on github
Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A: it is a great way to back up remotely. Also if multiple people work on the same project it's probably better to keep a separate main version.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: if others collaborate, it can cause collisions.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
A: fork is a clone of a repository on github. Clone is a copy of a whole repository. It can be local, remote. Branches are labels added to commits. Fork is to create my own flavor of a project, work on it as an administrator. Clone is to work on my own project, or if I'm a collaborator in a project, and my contribution is tracked. Branches are for trying out features in a project.

Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
A: merging differences are easier. If we had only the local branch, merging with remote would be more steps including interactions between local and remote branches. This way most of the conflicts can be resolved on local machine and remote can be updated. Only one local-remote connection to update the local repository and only one local-remote connection to update the remote repository after merging locally.

Q:How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Q:When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
