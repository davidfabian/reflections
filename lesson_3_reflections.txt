lesson 3 reflections, created on github
Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A: it is a great way to back up remotely. Also if multiple people work on the same project it's probably better to keep a separate main version.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: if others collaborate, it can cause collisions.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Q:How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Q:When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
